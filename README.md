## Holbertonschool Machine Learning

## Course Overview

## Learning Objectives

This course aims to provide learners with a fundamental understanding of vectors and matrices, and their operations using the Python library Numpy. By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

- Define and differentiate between vectors and matrices
- Explain what a transpose is and perform transpositions on matrices
- Understand the shape of a matrix and its importance in matrix operations
- Define and use slicing to extract sub-arrays from vectors and matrices
- Explain and perform element-wise operations on vectors and matrices
- Concatenate vectors and matrices
- Understand and perform dot product and matrix multiplication
- Explain the importance of parallelization in matrix operations
- Understand the concept of broadcasting in Numpy
## Requirements

Python Scripts: Learners will use Python 3.5 or higher and the following editors: vi, vim, or emacs
Numpy: Version 1.15 or higher
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: All files will be interpreted/compiled on this platform
Code formatting: Learners should follow pycodestyle (version 2.5) and add a new line at the end of each file
Documentation: All modules, classes, and functions should have documentation using the format python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
No module imports: Unless otherwise noted, learners are not allowed to import any module
Executable files: All files must be executable
File length: The length of the files will be tested using wc
Project Structure

The project should have a README.md file at the root of the project folder. Learners should organize their code into modules, each with a clear and descriptive name that reflects its purpose. The main module should contain the code to demonstrate the operations taught in the course. Learners should use appropriate naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
